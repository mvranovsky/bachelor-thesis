abstract = {The BRAHMS experiment at RHIC was conceived to pursue the understanding of nuclear matter under extreme conditions by detailed measurements of charged hadrons over the widest possible range of rapidity and transverse momentum. The experiment consists of two spectrometers with complementary charged hadron detection capabilities as well as a series of global detectors for event characterization. A series of tracking detectors, time-of-flight arms and Cherenkov detectors enables momentum determination and particle identification over a wide range of rapidity and transverse momentum. Technical details and performance results are presented for the various detector subsystems. The performance of the entire system working together is shown to meet the goals of the experiment.}

The detector amplification stage, realized with a structure very similar to a GEM foil, is embedded through a resistive layer in the readout board. A cathode electrode, defining the gas conversion/drift gap, completes the detector mechanics. The new structure, that we call micro-Resistive WELL (μ-RWELL), has some characteristics in common with previous MPGDs, such as C.A.T. and WELL, developed more than ten years ago. The prototype object of the present study has been realized  in the 2009 by TE-MPE-EM Workshop at CERN. The new architecture is a very compact MPGD,  robust against discharges and exhibiting a large gain (∼ 6 × 103), simple to construct and easy for engineering and then suitable for large area tracking devices as well as huge calorimetric apparata.}

Charged particles with momenta greater than 100MeV/c are recorded. Multiplicities in excess of 3000 tracks per event are routinely reconstructed in the software. The TPC measures 4m in diameter by 4.2m long, making it the largest TPC in the world.}
